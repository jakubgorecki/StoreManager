# StoreManager
This is my first personal project in Java (JavaFX) after a year of studying Computer Science.
In essence, it is a desktop application desired to help small retail stores to manage their business.
Since the project was also used for my school assignment, I have also attached a documentation folder with more information on the app.

Note: The Sales History PDF is at the moment not working correctly, as the TextColumn class from pdfjet is not available for the open-source programming.
